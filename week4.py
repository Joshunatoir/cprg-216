#this is the week 4 of python
#software development life cycle
#basically make sudo code or flow chart to give a foundation of the program
# a statement is a complete 
# a variable has a type (float, int, str, boolean), size(in bytes, int:4 bytes, float:8 or 16 bytes), name, address, value
# apearantly casting the variable is [ float(x) ]
# print is a function called:
    # i guess if you change the type that a variable is then it is calling a function 

# #examples
# x = 2
# y = 3.5
# msg = "hello"
# condition = True
# print(x)
# float(x)
# print(x)

# print(y)
# int(y)
# print(y)

# # review program, yay!

# print("hulo, welcom to the softwar. . ")

# usr_in = str(input("please type something because this is a user input, which only continues the program after you have hit enter."))
# print ("you typed:",usr_in)

# name = str(input("what is ur nam"))
# age = str(input("please type out your year of birth as words"))
# yob = int(input("now please type your age as a numeber, thx!"))
# print("user your entered name is:",name,"\nYour year of birth that you tediously typed out is:",age,"\nAnd your age")

# x = 3/4-2+5*0+5/2*3
# print (x)


#augmented operators
'''
x += 1 # x = x + 1
x -= 1 # x = x - 1
x *= 2 # x = x * 2
x /= 2 # x = x / 2
'''
# our screen is the standard output device: print outputs here

msg = "one two three four five"

#sep
# \t is a big space (its a tab) | \n: new line | \b: backspace |
#\r: returns cursor to the beginning of the line, posibly delete whole line |
# \a : audible bell by ascii | \xhh : hexidecimal where hh is a hexidecimal character
# \\: include a literal backslash | \': makes a ' | \" makes a " |
